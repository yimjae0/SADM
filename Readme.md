## Introduction  

Large-scale 3D point cloud datasets are essential for training deep neural networks but impose heavy computational burdens. We propose a **distribution matching-based dataset distillation framework** that jointly optimizes both geometric structures and orientations of synthetic 3D point clouds.  

**Key contributions:**  
- **Semantically Aligned Distribution Matching (SADM):** Introduces feature sorting within each channel to mitigate semantic misalignment caused by unordered point indices.  
- **Orientation-Aware Optimization:** Learns optimal rotations of synthetic 3D objects, reducing intra-class variability and improving feature alignment.  
- **Superior Generalization:** Achieves strong cross-architecture generalization across PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and Point Transformer.  

Our method consistently outperforms existing dataset distillation and coreset selection approaches on benchmarks such as ModelNet10, ModelNet40, ShapeNet, and ScanObjectNN.

We visualize the distilled synthetic datasets compared with baseline methods (DC, DM) on ModelNet40. Our method preserves the semantic structure of 3D objects (e.g., edges, corners, class-specific shapes), while existing methods tend to collapse to noisy or less informative patterns.
